								<h2>Custom Notes<br />
								</h2>
									<p>We provide hand crafted notes designed to condense the topics for the state exam
									into easy to use, readable and most importantly understandable chunks to use as a
									study aid come exam time. </p>
									<p>The student will work through the examples in the notes
									in the lessons, which are broken up by topic with emphasis on identifying how to
									answer the question.</p>
									<p>During your first session the student will be provided with a 
										folder to use throughout the year. The notes for each section will be provided each week, 
										to produce a study guide made by the students themselves to use come exam time.</p>

								<h2>Learning &amp; Class Sizes<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Our class sizes are kept small to maximise the time we can spend with each pupil by taking a team
									teaching approach, this will enable us to teach the material while at the same time helping individuals. 
									<br />
								</p>
								<p>We put a very strong emphasis on understanding the concepts being taught and actually teaching students
									how to solve problems themselves. Maths is different from other leaving cert subjects in that to
									succeed in the state exam rote learning doesn't work, we teach students to use the skills they learn
									with us and how to apply them to problems.<br />
